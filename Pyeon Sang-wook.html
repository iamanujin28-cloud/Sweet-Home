        <h2> About Pyeon Sang-wook </h2>
        <p> Sang-Wook is a contract killer with intimidating burn scars (a former detective in the webtoon). Years before the monsterization incident, his home was burned down while his father was still inside, and young Sang-Wook was unable to rescue him. The cause of the fire is "a prank". Justice wasn&rsquo;t served as the perpetrator was released shortly after the incident. The man&rsquo;s lack of remorse broke Sang-Wook&rsquo;s faith in the system, so the boy confronted and killed the unrepentant man with a knife around a year after.</p>
